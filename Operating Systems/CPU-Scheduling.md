## Task 1: Implementing Basic CPU Scheduling Algorithms

**Description:**  
Implement the following CPU scheduling algorithms:
1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
3. Round Robin (use a time quantum of your choice)

Each program should:
- Accept a list of processes (with their arrival time and burst time) as input.
- Calculate and display the average waiting time and turnaround time.

**Objective:**  
Understand how different scheduling strategies affect process execution and system performance.

**Hints:**  
- Represent each process as an object or a simple data structure.
- Use simple arrays or lists to manage the queue of processes.
- Focus first on getting correct results before optimizing your code.
