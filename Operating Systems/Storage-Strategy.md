## Task 1: Research and Design a Storage and I/O Strategy for a Portable Computing Device

**Scenario:**  
You are hired as a junior systems architect by a company developing a new portable computing device (e.g., a tablet, a wearable device, or a smart home assistant).  
Your task is to research current real-world storage and I/O technologies and propose a basic design for how your device should manage storage and handle I/O operations.

**Research and Report Requirements:**

1. **Storage Strategy:**
   - Identify and explain at least three types of storage you would include in your device (e.g., cache, RAM, flash storage, cloud connectivity).
   - For each storage type, specify:
     - Expected speed (relative comparison)
     - Expected capacity
     - Whether it is volatile or non-volatile
     - Cost trade-offs
   - Draw a simple diagram of your proposed storage hierarchy.

2. **I/O System Design:**
   - Identify at least two types of I/O devices your system would handle (e.g., touchscreen, sensors, camera, wireless communication).
   - Describe the role of device controllers and interrupts in managing these I/O devices.
   - Explain how buffering would be used to optimize I/O performance for one of your devices.

3. **Challenges and Design Decisions:**
   - Discuss one potential bottleneck you foresee in your design (e.g., slow storage access, I/O device delays).
   - Suggest a simple strategy the operating system could use to address this bottleneck.

**Objective:**  
Apply theoretical knowledge from storage structures and I/O systems to design a basic but realistic storage and I/O management plan for a modern device, considering performance, cost, and user experience.
