## Task 1: Exploring Processes and Threads

**Description:**  
Research and create a short report that explains the difference between a process and a thread.  
Include two real-world examples: one where multiple processes are used and one where multiple threads within a single process are used.

**Objective:**  
Understand how processes and threads differ in structure and behavior, and recognize their usage in real-world computing scenarios.


## Task 2: Exploring Processes and Threads Using Code

**Description:**  
Create two simple programs:
1. A program that starts two independent processes that perform simple tasks (like printing a message or a calculation).
2. A program that creates two threads within the same process, where each thread performs a different simple task.

**Objective:**  
Understand how operating systems manage multiple processes and threads through hands-on coding.

**Note:**  
Be ready to discuss: What differences did you notice between creating new processes and creating new threads?
