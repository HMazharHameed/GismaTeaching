## Task 1: Design a Greedy Algorithm

**Problem Statement:**  
You are given a list of non-overlapping time intervals representing tasks, each with a start and end time.  
Design a greedy algorithm that selects the maximum number of tasks you can complete without overlaps.


**Expected Output:**  
Return the maximum number of tasks that can be scheduled without time conflicts.

**Objective:**  
Apply a greedy strategy to solve a real-world scheduling problem. Focus on choosing tasks in a way that leaves room for others and leads to a globally optimal result.

**Constraints:**
- All time intervals are positive integers.
- No two tasks should overlap.
- Try to solve it using a greedy approach â€” not brute force.
