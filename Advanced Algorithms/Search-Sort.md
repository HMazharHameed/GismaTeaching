## Task 1: Implement and Compare Search and Sort Algorithms

**Description:**  
Implement the following algorithms in Java/Python:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Create a small Java program or python notebook where:
1. The user inputs an array of integers.
2. The array is sorted using both Merge Sort and Quick Sort (you can compare the results).
3. The user enters a number to search, and both Linear and Binary Search are applied (Binary Search after sorting).
4. Output the result of each search and count the number of steps taken.


**Objective:**  
Understand the working of basic search and sort algorithms, analyze their efficiency, and observe how they behave with different input sizes.
