## Task 1: Choosing and Using the Right Data Structure

**Description:**  
You are given three real-world scenarios. For each, identify the most suitable data structure among **linked list**, **hash map**, **set**, or **heap**, and justify your choice.

**Scenarios:**
1. Building an autocomplete feature that stores word frequencies and retrieves the most common suggestions quickly.
2. Keeping track of unique user IDs that have accessed a secure resource during the day.
3. Implementing a music playlist where songs can be inserted or removed dynamically at any position.

**Your task is to:**
- Choose the best-fitting data structure for each scenario.
- Justify each choice in 2â€“3 sentences based on time complexity and functionality.
- Optional: Implement one of the scenarios in code (Python or pseudocode).

**Objective:**  
Reinforce your understanding of non-linear data structures by applying them to real-world contexts and comparing their trade-offs.
