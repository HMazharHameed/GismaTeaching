## Task 1: Tree Traversal Problem â€“ LeetCode Style

**Problem Statement:**  
Given the root of a binary tree, return the values of the nodes **in inorder traversal**.

**Instructions:**  
1. You are given a binary tree structure. Write a function to return the inorder traversal of its node values.
2. Do not use recursion. Try using a stack to simulate the traversal (iterative solution).

**Optional Extension:**  
Can you also write the **preorder** and **postorder** versions of the traversal using a similar approach?

**Objective:**  
Apply your understanding of tree traversal algorithms to solve real-world problems. Think about memory usage, recursion vs. iteration, and the order of visiting nodes.
