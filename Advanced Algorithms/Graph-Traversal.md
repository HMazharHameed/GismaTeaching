## Task 1: Graph Traversal â€“ DFS and BFS

**Problem Statement:**  
You are given a graph represented as an adjacency list and a starting node.  
Write two functions:
1. One that performs **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
2. One that performs **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
Return the list of nodes visited in the order they were explored.


**Constraints:**
- All nodes are uniquely labeled.
- You may assume the graph is connected and acyclic.
- Use a queue for BFS and a stack (or recursion) for DFS.

**Objective:**  
Demonstrate a clear understanding of how DFS and BFS explore a graph differently. Recognize situations where one is more effective than the other.
