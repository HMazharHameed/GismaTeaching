## Task 1: Visualizing Complexity Classes

**Description:**  
Use a plotting tool (e.g., Python with matplotlib or Desmos) to visualize different growth rates:  
- O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²)

Your task is to:

1. Plot all five functions on the same graph for values of n from 1 to 100000  
2. Submit the plot and a short explanation (100–150 words) of what the graph reveals about scalability  

**Objective:**  
Understand how complexity classes behave with increasing input and how they affect system performance.
