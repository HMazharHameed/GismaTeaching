## Task 1: Working with Linear Data Structures

**Description:**  
You are tasked with simulating a simple helpdesk ticket system using two data structures:

1. Use a **queue** to represent incoming support requests (FIFO).
2. Use a **stack** to simulate a developer’s undo history for editing a ticket.

Your task is to:

- Write or review basic implementations of a queue and a stack (in pseudocode or Python).
- Add sample operations: enqueue/dequeue for tickets, push/pop for undo steps.
- Write a short reflection (150–200 words) explaining:
  - Why queues are appropriate for support ticket handling
  - Why stacks fit the undo functionality

**Objective:**  
Apply real-world reasoning to select and implement appropriate linear data structures and understand their strengths in action-driven scenarios.
