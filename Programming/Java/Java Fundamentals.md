## (1) Sum of Two Integers

## Problem Statement

Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return the sum of the two integers.

## Example 1:
**Input**: num1 = 12, num2 = 5  
**Output**: 17  
**Explanation**: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.

## Example 2:
**Input**: num1 = -10, num2 = 4  
**Output**: -6  
**Explanation**: num1 is -10, num2 is 4, and their sum is -10 + 4 = -6, so -6 is returned.



## (2) Reverse a String

## Problem Statement

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.  

## Example 1:
**Input**:  
`s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]`  
**Output**:  
`["o","l","l","e","h"]`  

## Example 2:
**Input**:  
`s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]`  
**Output**:  
`["h","a","n","n","a","H"]` 

## (3) FizzBuzz

## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return a string array `answer` (1-indexed) where:

- `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if `i` is divisible by 3 and 5.
- `answer[i] == "Fizz"` if `i` is divisible by 3.
- `answer[i] == "Buzz"` if `i` is divisible by 5.
- `answer[i] == i` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

## Example 1:
**Input**:  
`n = 3`  
**Output**:  
`["1","2","Fizz"]`

## Example 2:
**Input**:  
`n = 5`  
**Output**:  
`["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]`

## Example 3:
**Input**:  
`n = 15`  
**Output**:  
`["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]`
