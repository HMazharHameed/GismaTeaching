## Sum of Two Integers

## Problem Statement

Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return the sum of the two integers.

## Example 1:
**Input**: num1 = 12, num2 = 5  
**Output**: 17  
**Explanation**: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.

## Example 2:
**Input**: num1 = -10, num2 = 4  
**Output**: -6  
**Explanation**: num1 is -10, num2 is 4, and their sum is -10 + 4 = -6, so -6 is returned.
