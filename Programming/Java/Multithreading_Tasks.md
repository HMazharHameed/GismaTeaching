# Multithreading Tasks in Java

## Task 1: Simple Multithreading Task

### Description
Write a Java program that creates multiple threads to perform different tasks concurrently. This task will help you understand how threads operate independently and concurrently.

### Instructions
- **Thread 1**: Prints numbers 1-10 with a short delay between each number.
- **Thread 2**: Prints letters A-J with a delay between each letter.
- **Thread 3**: Prints "Hello from Thread" repeatedly at intervals.


## Task 2: Sensor Data Simulation with Multithreading

### Description
Write a Java program that simulates multiple sensors collecting data concurrently. This task helps you understand independent thread operations in a real-world scenario.

### Instructions
- **Temperature Sensor (Thread 1)**: Prints a random temperature reading between -10°C and 35°C every 500 milliseconds.
- **Humidity Sensor (Thread 2)**: Prints a random humidity level between 20% and 80% every 700 milliseconds.
- **Pressure Sensor (Thread 3)**: Prints a random pressure value between 950 and 1050 hPa every 1 second.
