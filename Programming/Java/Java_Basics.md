## Hands-on Labs

### Set Up Your Java Environment
Ensure that you have installed Java and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. Write and run a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to verify your setup.

### Java Syntax Practice

1. **Basic Input and Output:**
   - **Question:** Write a Java program that takes the user's name as input and prints "Hello, [Name]!"
   - **Concepts:** Using `Scanner` for input and `System.out.println` for output.

2. **Arithmetic Operations:**
   - **Question:** Write a Java program that takes two numbers as input from the user and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
   - **Concepts:** Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), user input.

3. **Swap Two Numbers:**
   - **Question:** Write a Java program to swap two numbers without using a third variable.
   - **Concepts:** Variable manipulation.

4. **Find the Largest of Three Numbers:**
   - **Question:** Write a Java program to find the largest of three numbers provided by the user.
   - **Concepts:** `if-else` statements, comparison operators.

5. **Check Prime Number:**
   - **Question:** Write a Java program to check if a number entered by the user is a prime number.
   - **Concepts:** Loops, conditional statements.

6. **Multiplication Table:**
   - **Question:** Write a Java program that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table up to 10.
   - **Concepts:** Loops, arithmetic operations.

7. **Factorial of a Number:**
   - **Question:** Write a Java program that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.
   - **Concepts:** Loops, basic math.

8. **Palindrome Check:**
   - **Question:** Write a Java program to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
   - **Concepts:** String manipulation, loops.

9. **Fibonacci Series:**
   - **Question:** Write a Java program to generate the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
   - **Concepts:** Loops, variables.
