# ETL and ELT in Big Data Workflows

## Workflow Design Challenge

- Choose a real-world problem (for example: online retail sales, healthcare records, or financial transactions).
- Describe a simple ETL or ELT workflow you would recommend for that problem:
  - What type of data is extracted?
  - What transformations are needed?
  - Where is the data loaded?

## Reflection

- What do you think is the biggest challenge when designing ETL or ELT pipelines, and why?
