# Distributed Storage Concepts

## System and Format Matching

- Select one distributed storage system (for example: HDFS, Amazon S3, or Google Cloud Storage).
- Pick three different data formats (for example: CSV, JSON, Parquet, Avro).
- For each format, explain:
  - Why it might perform well or poorly in that environment.
  - What kind of workload or use case it is best suited for (e.g., logs, analytics, images).

## Comparative Analysis

- Write a short comparison discussing:
  - Which format you would recommend as the default choice in that distributed environment, and why.
  - When you might **combine** two formats for better performance (give at least one example, e.g., storing raw data in JSON but analytics data in Parquet).

## Reflection

- What did you find most interesting or unexpected when thinking about formats and storage systems together?
