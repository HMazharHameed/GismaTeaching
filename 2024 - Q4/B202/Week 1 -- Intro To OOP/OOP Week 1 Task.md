## Hands-on Labs

### Task 1: Set Up Your Java Environment
Ensure that you have installed Java and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. Write and run a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to verify your setup.

### Task 2: Basic Java Syntax Practice
Create Java programs that practice basic syntax elements such as variables, constants, operators, and loops. For example, write a program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop.

### Task 3: Conditional Statements Exercise
Develop a Java program that uses if-else statements to determine if a given number is positive, negative, or zero. Include additional conditions to categorize the number as odd or even.
