## Task 1: Identifying Good vs. Bad Software Design

**Description:**  
Review two system interface screenshots provided in the repository. One represents a well-designed system; the other contains common design flaws (e.g., poor layout, no modularity, lack of feedback).  
Write a short report (approx. 150–200 words) comparing the two designs. Highlight 3–4 key differences and explain why one design is more effective than the other.

**Objective:**  
Develop an understanding of what makes software design effective by analyzing real-world examples. Build awareness of design decisions that impact usability, structure, and maintainability.
