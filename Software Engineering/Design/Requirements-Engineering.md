## Task 1: Writing Effective Software Requirements

**Description:**  
You are given a short user story:  
*"A user wants to book an appointment online quickly and without hassle."*  

Your task is to:  
1. Identify and list at least **three functional** and **two non-functional** requirements based on this user story.  
2. Make sure your requirements are clear, specific, and testable (avoid vague terms like “easy” or “fast”).  
3. Submit your final list in your DigiLog or as a plain text file.

**Objective:**  
Practice breaking down informal user input into well-structured software requirements. This helps develop analytical thinking and prepares you for real-world communication with stakeholders.
