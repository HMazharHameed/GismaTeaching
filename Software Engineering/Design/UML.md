## Task: Creating UML Diagrams for a Booking System

**Description:**  
You are designing a simple **appointment booking system** for a clinic. Your task is to create three UML diagrams to model different aspects of the system:

1. **Use Case Diagram** – Show the interactions between actors (e.g., patient, receptionist, admin) and system functionalities (e.g., book appointment, cancel appointment).
2. **Class Diagram** – Define key classes such as Patient, Appointment, Doctor, and their relationships, attributes, and methods.
3. **Sequence Diagram** – Model the interaction for the “Book Appointment” use case, showing how objects exchange messages over time.

**Your submission should include:**
- All three diagrams (hand-drawn or created using a tool like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or StarUML)
- A short explanation (100–150 words) for each diagram describing what it represents

**Objective:**  
Learn how to translate requirements into UML diagrams and use modeling techniques to represent both static structure and dynamic behavior of a software system.
