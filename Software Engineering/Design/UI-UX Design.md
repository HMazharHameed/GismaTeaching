## Task: Design a Wireframe for a Simple User Interface

**Description:**  
Choose a simple software system (e.g., a food delivery app, online course dashboard, or ticket booking system).  
Design a basic **wireframe** showing the main screen or user flow, such as browsing items or placing an order.

Use a free tool like [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), or even pen and paper (scanned or photographed) to sketch your interface.  
Focus on layout, usability, and clarity — not on colors or detailed styling.

**Your wireframe must include:**
- A clear layout with interface elements (e.g., buttons, navigation, input fields)
- Basic annotations to explain user interaction (e.g., "Click here to add to cart")
- A short paragraph (100–150 words) explaining your design decisions

**Objective:**  
Apply UI/UX principles to structure a user-friendly interface and reflect on how layout and clarity impact the user experience.
