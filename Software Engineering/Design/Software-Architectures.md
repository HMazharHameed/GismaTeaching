## Task 1: Identify and Compare Software Architectures

**Description:**  
Choose a real-world application you use frequently (e.g., a food delivery app, e-commerce platform, or online banking system).  
Based on your understanding, describe whether it most likely uses a **monolithic**, **modular**, or **layered** architecture.

**Your response should include:**
- A brief description of the application and its main features
- An explanation of which architecture style it appears to follow
- Justification based on how the system is organized or behaves (e.g., is it tightly integrated? Does it seem modular or layered?)
- A paragraph on the **benefits and limitations** of using that architecture for this system

**Objective:**  
Practice recognizing architecture patterns in real-world systems and critically evaluating their use in terms of maintainability, scalability, and modularity.


## Task 2: Redesign a System Using a Modern Architecture Style

**Description:**  
Pick a traditional application youâ€™re familiar with (e.g., a hotel booking system, university portal, or shopping cart).  
Redesign it using one of the following architecture styles:  
- **Microservices**  
- **Serverless**  
- **Event-Driven**

**Your submission should include:**
- A short description of the original (monolithic) system and its core components
- A diagram (hand-drawn or digital) showing the redesigned architecture
- Justification for choosing a specific architecture style
- A paragraph describing how the new architecture would improve scalability, flexibility, or maintainability

**Objective:**  
Understand the practical implications of applying modern architecture styles by redesigning a legacy system into a more flexible and scalable solution.
