# Introduction to MongoDB and NoSQL Concepts


## Objective:
This assignment will test your understanding of NoSQL concepts, MongoDB basics, and CRUD operations.

---

## Task 1: Understanding NoSQL  
Explain in your own words:  
1. The key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.  
2. When would you prefer MongoDB over a relational database? Provide an example.  

---

## Task 2: Setting Up MongoDB  
1. Ensure MongoDB Community Edition is installed on your system.  
2. Use `mongosh` or MongoDB Compass to create a new database named `student_db`.  
3. Confirm the setup by displaying the list of databases.  

---

## Task 3: Creating & Inserting Documents  
1. Inside `student_db`, create a collection called `students`.  
2. Insert sample student records into the collection, including details, such as name, age, course, and email.  
3. Verify that the documents have been inserted by retrieving all records.  

---

## Task 4: Querying Data  
Use queries to retrieve:  
1. All students older than a certain age.  
2. Only the name and course of all students, excluding other fields.  
3. A student based on their email address.  

Write the queries and paste the output.  

---

## Task 5: Updating & Deleting Data  
1. Update a student's course to a new value.  
2. Delete a student who meets a certain condition (e.g., based on age).  
3. Show the remaining students after deletion.  

Write the queries and paste the output.
